## THE PROCESS
1.  Run - $ php FDFBulkFormatter.php
    -- ATM, this finds all UNFI items that appear to be in use at Denfeld, and creates a .fdf file in fdfs/ which can be used to generate a completed bulk bin form.
2.  Use pdftk to create bulk bins from .fdf files
    -- Before doing this, clean all .fdf files out of fdfs/ dir
    -- $ pdftk <editable-pdf-name.pdf> fill_form <filename>.fdf output <outfile-name>.pdf
    -- Note, the editable-pdf-templates must be in this dir
    -- eg - $ for file in *.fdf; do pdftk og.pdf fill_form $file output $file.'.fin.pdf'; done

2.2 I'm sick of typing these commands repeatedly
    -- for file in *.fin.pdf; do mv $file finishedPdfs/; done
    -- for file in *.fdf; do rm $file; done
    ## check form input field names/info
    -- pdftk input.pdf dump_data_fields


## MISSING PIECES
1.  FDFBulkFormatter.php doesn't yet include nutritional info, this can easily be added. 
2.  Data entry of nutrition facts
3.  In FDFBulkFormatter.php, separate organic, conventional, etc. 
4.  See if barcodes can be created via fdf 

## NOTES
1.  Most bulk items don't have ingredients. The ingredients that are being included currently are only if the bulk item has a corresponding scaleItem on linkedPLU
